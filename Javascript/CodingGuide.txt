Work OOP wherever possible and whenever serialization is needed (Users, Warnings).

Documentation:

-Code should be self-documentation for the 'what' and 'how'.
-If code is not clear, explain the line.
-Separate code in blocks and comment what that block achieves.
-Use comments to explain the 'why'.


Commands:
-Each command gets its own class.
-Place each command in the commands folder and within the folder for its group (group per intended user such as user or admin).
-Work async with promises.
